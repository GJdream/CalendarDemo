Readme - CalendarDemo

I have created a class called CalendarView which lets you show a simple calendar view with current month and buttons to navigate back and forth between months
The software is written from scratch, but I have put it under the MIT license - to use it simply import the classes
CalendarView.h and CalendarView.m into your xcode project and create an instance and add as subview....

Customize or use it as is ...
